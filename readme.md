# Application Description

This application is a network traffic redirector. It listens on one or more UDP and TCP ports and forwards the received traffic to one or more UDP and TCP ports. The application is designed to be run from the command line and accepts the following arguments:

1. `in_ports`: A comma-separated list of input ports. These are the ports on which the application listens for incoming traffic.
2. `out_ports`: A comma-separated list of output ports. These are the ports to which the application forwards the incoming traffic.
3. `host`: The host on which the application listens for incoming traffic. If not specified, the application defaults to `localhost`.
4. `out_host`: The host to which the application forwards the incoming traffic. If not specified, the application defaults to the same host as the input.

The application creates a UDP server for each input port and a TCP server for each input port. When the application receives a message on a UDP server, it forwards the message to the corresponding output port. When the application receives a connection on a TCP server, it reads the data from the connection, forwards the data to the corresponding output port, and then forwards the response from the output port back to the original connection.

The application is designed to be run from the command line. To start the application, run `npm start` followed by the input ports, output ports, host, and output host. If any of these arguments are not specified, the application will use the default values.

The application is also designed to handle multiple input and output ports. To specify multiple input and output ports, separate the port numbers with a comma. For example, to start the application with two input ports (80 and 81) and two output ports (8080 and 8081), run `npm start 80,81 8080,8081`.

The application is written in JavaScript and uses the `net` and `dgram` modules to create the UDP and TCP servers. The application is also designed to be run as a module, so it can be imported and used in other applications.

For more information on how to use the application, see the `---Usage---` section in the `index.js` file.
